1. I chose 500 as my final size because it provides a decent amount of trees. This makes it easier to see the animation and it also has a good run time.
2. I chose 100 repetitions because it provided a decent amount of sample size, which will help me pinpoint the accurate and precise result.
3. Through my testing, it showed that the burning time of the trees increase as the size of the board increases.
4. The relationship between maximum burn time and board size is that as the board size increases, the maximum burn time will also increase. I tested this by running my average runs method on every 5 interval of board sizes 100, 500 and 1000. Then I compared the maximum burn time of each of those board size. I found out that the biggest board (1000) had the largest max burn time and the smallest (100) had the smallest max burn time.
5. The density of trees that yield the max burn time was .60. .60 for density consistently yielded the highest burn time amongst all three board sizes.
